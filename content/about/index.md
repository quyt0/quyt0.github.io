Hey, thanks for stopping by.‼️

My name is **Doan Duy Phuc**. You can call me **"Cuýt"**.
I'm studying **Information Security** at **PTIT (Posts and Telecommunications Institute of Technology)** in Hanoi, Vietnam.  
I also spend a questionable amount of time breaking things that were definitely not designed to be broken that way. 🫠

I enjoy playing **CTFs**, and among all categories, I'm most interested in **Web and Forensics**. I’m still learning, still making mistakes, and still spending more time than I'd like figuring out why something didn't work the way I expected.  
CTFs are mostly a way for me to practice and explore things hands-on, and over time, I’m working toward becoming an **aspiring Web Pentester** — one bug, one failed exploit, and one late night at a time.

This blog is where I dump things I’ve learned along the way: CTF write-ups, weird bugs, small “oh wow, that actually works” moments, and notes I write mainly so future-me doesn’t spend another three hours rediscovering the same mistake.

Nothing here is perfectly polished. Some posts are half-explanations, some are overkill, and some exist purely because something annoyed me until I understood it.

Feel free to look around, experiment, and break things responsibly — preferably not in production. 🥰

## A few small milestones
